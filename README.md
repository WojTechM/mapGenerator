# Map Generator

A group of 4 people and one goal in mind - create a map generator.

This repository is the result of our attempt to create something cool in a very limited time.
We want to work on this project for 12 hours in total; first 6 hours, and also day 1 of our coding challenge passed. 
We ended up with a prototype that generates terrain: mountains, highlands, lowlands and oceans.

Things to do:
- Lib to print colored stuff in console
- Every part of the process has 2 modes of work:
    1. Default - quick execution
    2. Presentation mode - each step of the process is displayed
- Things to put on the map:
    - Mountains, highlands and lowlands
    - Rivers, lakes, oceans
    - Forests, deserts, grasslands
